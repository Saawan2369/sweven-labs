# Experiments

This directory contains AI/ML experiments and prototypes.

## Structure

Each experiment should have its own subdirectory with:
- A descriptive name (e.g., `sentiment-analysis-transformer`)
- A README.md explaining the experiment
- Source code and configuration files
- Results and findings

## Example Experiments

- Image classification models
- Natural language processing experiments
- Reinforcement learning agents
- Generative AI prototypes
- Time series forecasting models

## Best Practices

1. Document your hypothesis and goals
2. Track hyperparameters and configurations
3. Save experiment results and metrics
4. Version your experiment code
5. Clean up unnecessary files after experiments conclude
